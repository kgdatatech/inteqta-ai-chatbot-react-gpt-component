## Installation

To install and run the ChatBot component in your React project, follow the steps below:

### Part 1: Clone or Download the Files
Unzip the downloaded ChatBot package and copy the `ChatBot.jsx` component from the `src` folder into your React project.

### Part 2: Install Necessary Dependencies
Ensure that you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine. Then, run the following commands to install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Initialize your React project (if you haven't already)
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react

# Change directory to your project
cd my-app

# Install required dependencies
npm install react-icons tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

### Part 3: Install and Configure Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is used for styling the ChatBot component. Follow these steps to install and configure it:

Step 1: Install **Tailwind CSS** and **PostCSS**:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

Step 2: Generate the **Tailwind configuration** files:
```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Step 3: Open your `tailwind.config.js` file and replace its content with:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Step 4: In your `src/index.css` file, include the following Tailwind imports:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Part 4: Set Up Environment Variables

The ChatBot uses the OpenAI API for GPT-3.5 by default, but you can use any GPT model available in OpenAI. You need to create an environment variable for your OpenAI API key.

Step 1: Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (if it doesnâ€™t exist).

Step 2: Add the following environment variable:
```bash
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key, which you can get from [OpenAI's API website](https://beta.openai.com/).

You can update the model in the API call by modifying the model parameter to use any GPT model:
```javascript
body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'gpt-4',  // Example for switching to GPT-4
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'system',
        content: "Your system prompt here..."
      },
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: message,
      },
    ],
}),
```

### Part 5: Import and Use the ChatBot

Step 1: Import the ChatBot component into your React app:
```jsx
import ChatBot from './path-to-your-file/ChatBot';
```

Step 2: Customize any props or design elements to match your project.
